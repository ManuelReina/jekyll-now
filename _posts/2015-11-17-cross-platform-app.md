title: Angular2 + NativeScript + TypeScript  (VS 2015) – INTRO
published: true
---




It’s been a while since I’ve been looking for a way of reusing the business logic of our projects in a cross platform project. 

I started with angular 1.x and loved it. We also started to integrate typescript, which added more sugar to the formula.

Having hybrid web apps is good, but not good enough. We want to develop **cross platform native apps**. 

That being said, I am not an expert in JavaScript, in fact I come from a c# background, and I hated it but **JavaScript frameworks** like angular are growing rapidly, which is great for web development. 

I know there is a bunch of blog posts and tutorials focused on the above technologies, even though they are pretty new, but I wanted to create a set of posts introducing to **Angular2**, **NativeScript** and **TypeScript** with **Visual Studio 2015** as IDE and **Windows** as OS, which will help to consolidate my learning.

##  ** Why Angular2?**

Well I think Angular 1.x made our lives so easy, but they know that web development is changing rapidly, so in order to be competitive you need to be in constant change.

## ** Why TypeScript?**

I love typed languages so for me javascript + typescript is a very good combination.

## **Why NativeScript?**

Well after playing a bit with ReactNative and NativeScript, I did choose NativeScript due to its compatibility with Angular2 and TypeScript.
I like the idea of “**one UI to rule them all**” except maybe for web, but that is another discussion.

## **Blog Posts**

I would like to **create 3 blog posts** (if my 3 year old son lets me):

1. In my first post I will create an **Angular hello-world** app with TypeScript and VS 2015
2. The second will be focused on creating a **NativeScript app in Android.**
3. In the third I will **reuse angular components** between the web app and the native android app
